I look around me and all theire faces are glowing, is the light beeming from theire faces to the screens or is it the other way around ?

## I am free of the burden of carrying it wherever I go

at least I am free of that !

## People stopped having experiences

## Slow down to the natural rythm of my body and mind

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
