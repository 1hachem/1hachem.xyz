People will notice that they lost their smartphones in less than 15 minutes,
"low battery anxiety" is now a term in psychology,
and many among us find phones essential to fall asleep,
it's no secret that humans are growing more and more attached to their smartphones,
and for an Arab who's grandfathers were nomads roaming the earth this materialistic attachment feels tying to me.

## I am free of the burden of carrying it wherever I go

At least I am free of that !

## Spare me from your mediocre social interaction

## I refuse to murder my imagination

It's often advertised that smart phones are facilitators of imagination,
you can create music, paint paintings, write books,
and visualize your designs, this is true,
but also false in the same time, sadly we often murder our creativity and imagination
with constant distraction, how can someone imagination flourish if one is always
consuming the products of others imagination, how can someone wonder about the reality of the world,
reflect on his own ideas and beliefs or build honest opinions and points of view if his mind is in a constant distraction.

## If its urgent it will find its way

## Reality is my default

Reality is my default I want to grow from it not escape from it !

## People stopped having experiences

Sometimes I think that humans have ceased to experience. We are illusioned by how others capture their experiences.
We compare our's to that illusion, we become obsessed by how we can capture it the same way they did,
forgetting in the process to live that moment, forgetting to smile back ...

## I need to slowdown

Are we really meant to be everywhere, everybody in every moment of the day ?
or should we come back to the natural pace and rhythm of our brain and body.

## Its strongly addictive

Sure, you may be tempted to think that you can discipline yourself, control your usage,
but to be realistic you cant escape from anything unless you create a larger force in an opposite direction.
For my opinion that force is to completely remove the smartphone from my life, 22 years of doing that and I am still alive.
