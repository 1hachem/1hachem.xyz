## Motivation

Recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) made many startups, corporations` and individuals aware of AI's
potential to automate many of their daunting tasks.

We aim to democratize the use of AI systems by providing an end-to-end AI asset automatically.

We propose a system design that leverages the unprecedented availability of open-source AI models (Huggingface, Github ..)
to build what we call model bases and we utilize the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of today's LLMs to solve tasks
such as problem scoping,
task planning, model selection, and reflecting over proposed prototypes.

Additionally, we use tools like Docker to facilitate ease of reproducibility, integration, and scaling of these prototypes.
