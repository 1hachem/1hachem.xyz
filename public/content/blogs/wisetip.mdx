## Problem

Useful tips around the internet are buried under a lot of noise (intros, stretched content ...),
this is mainly due to policies and recommendation algorithms of content platforms (e.g. youtube).
We value your time, memory and attention, all the tips you need are in one place straight to the point.

## Vision

We want to build tools that protect human weaknesses instead of exploiting them, each one solves one problem at a time.

Less is more, with the age of generative AI less content is more, we aim to provide little but high quality content,
we are working on to reverse-making platforms such as youtube, facebook, instagram ...

We aim to build alternatives that increase the quality of life for people, protect their attention, social life, spending habits ... and so on.

we make profit from donations and one-time payments.
