Jobs today are no longer the same as they were few years ago.
Workers at factories doing a monotonous monition of pushing a button, turning a lever or placing a wheel on a car are replaced with machines.
On a micro level this is a disaster, a person lost his job, but on the macro level its a blessing, a job where people used to cut their fingers (risk) and mindlessly repeat the same action (monotony) has disappeared.

People coped with this change and jobs were nudged to a higher level.

## AI assistance

With the arrival of AI assistant models this is going to be more and more the case today, any task that can be formulated as a set of rules (procedural) can and will be automated,
leaving more time and mental space for the human to focus more on the creative and problem solving aspect of their work (abstractive).

## Abstraction is the key

Job title tomorrow = abstraction(job title now)

Examples :

- Software engineers, AI engineers, DevOps -> **Builders** who are fluent in using and building digital tools
- UI/UX designers, graphic designers, copy writers -> **Presenters** who are capable of connecting people with these tools

## How are we going to know who is who ?

I always fidget with the idea of abstract testing, how can we measure the intelligence of a person, his compatibility, his learning curve and so on ...
Designing effective tests that outperform traditional approaches is crucial in identifying the right person for the right job.

**Testers** people who can design these tests.

## Think about it

This schema is still under work, think about it and you can find new titles (e.g. **Idea generators**).
