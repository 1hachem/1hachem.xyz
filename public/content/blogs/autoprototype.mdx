## Motivation

Recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) made many startups, corporations and individuals aware of <a className="text-blue-500">AI's
potential in automating</a> many of their daunting tasks. However customized AI assets today come at a high price.

Many feel left behind out in the <a className="text-blue-300">cold</a>, confused about what to do
and fearing that they will be replaced by AI.

Augmenting humans with AI is a becoming more and more relevant today. We believe that AI should be accessible to everyone everywhere.

We aim to democratize AI by providing an end-to-end system that allows users to build AI assets automatically !

## Contribution

We propose a system-design that leverages the ever increasing availability of open-source AI models (<a className="text-yellow-500">Huggingface</a>, <a className="text-blue-500">Github</a> ...)
and the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of today's LLMs to solve the following tasks :

- problems scoping : suggesting questions to users to understand and to translate their problems into one or many machine learning tasks.
- task planning : designing how the tasks should be addressed, setting up the inputs, outputs and the dependencies of each task in the pipeline.
- model selection : selecting the right model in each step of the pipeline.
- reflecting over proposed prototypes : checking the consistency of the proposed pipeline and reflecting over what could be a better proposition.

Additionally, we use tools like <a className="text-blue-400">Docker</a> to ease building and scaling these AI prototypes.

## System design

Here is a high level overview of how the system works :

## Discussion

- New models can easily be added to the model base.

- Human expertise can be programmatically encoded (for example as python functions) to extend the model base,
  building a competitive advantage for companies over time and concretizing their know-how.
