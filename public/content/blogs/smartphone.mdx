If you are here than probably you asked me the famous question:

**"Hachem, why don't you have a smartphone just like any normal human being ?"**

Well ... it seems that "normal people" will have a mini heart attack if they check for their phone in the wrong pocket,
"low battery anxiety" is now a thing with them, and most can't fall asleep without their phones.

it's no secret that people are growing more and more attached to their smartphones,
and for an African, who's grandfathers were nomads roaming the earth this materialistic attachment feels tying to me.

## I don't want to have a mini heart attack or worry for forgetting my charger

I want to break free from these small, but constant nagging effects of attachment to a device.

## Spare me please from today's mediocre social interaction

What ? do you think that I can have a meaningful conversation with you when every few minutes you check your phone ?
if you are going to stop being present every notification you get ?

## I refuse to murder my imagination

I will borrow the words of _David Amadio_ in his awesome _flip phone manifesto_ :  
"It's often advertised that smart phones are facilitators of imagination,
you can create music, paint paintings, write books,
and visualize your designs, this is true,
but also false in the same time, sadly we often murder our creativity and imagination
with constant distraction, how can someone imagination flourish if one is always
consuming the products of others imagination, how can someone wonder about the reality of the world,
reflect on his own ideas and beliefs or build honest opinions and points of view if his mind is in a constant distraction."

## If its urgent it always finds its way to reach me

## Reality is my default

People escape reality, they look for escape from its ugliness, its chaos, from its hard times but its only
by facing these that a person grow.

## People stopped having experiences

Sometimes I think that humans have ceased to experience. We are illusioned by how others capture their experiences.
We compare our's to that illusion, and we become obsessed by how we can capture it the same way they do,
forgetting in the process to live a moment, forgetting to feel anything ...

## I need to slowdown

Are we really meant to be everywhere, everybody in every moment of the day ?
or should we come back to the natural pace and rhythm of our brain and body ?

## Its strongly addictive

Sure, you may be tempted to think that you can discipline yourself, control your usage, delete some apps and install others,
but to be realistic you can never escape your phone addiction unless you create a larger force in an opposite direction.
I came to the conclusion the the only great force that can shield me is to completely remove this device from my life,
22 years of doing that and I am still alive ...
