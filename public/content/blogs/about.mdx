## Hi there, I'm Hachem Betrouni

## Currently

<p className="text-sm">sep 2022 - today </p>I am working as CTO and AI engineer

We are building [Hyko.ai](https://www.hyko.ai/) a tool that would make it easier to understand
the needs of our clients and build automatic AI solutions for them !

I am also doing my final year at the [National Polytechnic School of Algiers](https://www.enp.edu.dz/)
soon I will graduate as an AI engineer.

## Future direction

I am learning fullstack engineering to bootstrap digital tools (I want to start solo-startups âœ¨).

I am also looking forward to joining [DeepMind]("https://www.deepmind.com/") as an AI engineer in the near future.
