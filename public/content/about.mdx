## Hi there, I'm Hachem Betrouni

## Currently

<p className="text-sm">sep 2022 - today </p>I am working as CTO and AI engineer
at [BIGmama Technology](https://www.big-mama.io/).

We are building [Hyko.ai](https://www.hyko.ai/) a tool that would make it easier to understand
the needs of our clients and build automatic AI solutions for them !

Me and Ouassim Ghribi are building digital tools, checkout [wisetip.xyz](https://beta.wisetip.xyz/) !

## Future direction

I am learning fullstack engineering to bootstrap digital tools (I want to start solo-startups âœ¨).

## Previously

in Ghana ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­, after the conference we backpacked the Volterra region for 20 days !

<p className="text-sm">July 2023</p>I successfully defended my thesis and
graduated from the [National Polytechnic School of
Algiers](https://www.enp.edu.dz/) as an AI engineer.

<p className="text-sm">May 2023</p>
Helped organizing IndabaX here in Algeria.

<p className="text-sm">feb 2022 - aug 2022</p>I worked for 6 months as an AI
research intern at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/), trying to predict
and generate new variants of Sars-CoV-2 using GANs (which failed miserably ðŸ¥¹).
Huge thank you to all the InstaDeepers for the amazing experience and the very
warm welcoming, I learned a lot with you !
