## Switch to linux

- The command line is powerful, there are plenty of useful tools that can save you a lot of time and teach you a lot about computers and programming.
- It's highly customizable which allows your productivity to go brrrrr !
- Linux is much more secure, unlike windows, you don't have to worry about viruses, malware or god forbids think about installing an antivirus.

## Read the market

A very good mentor are job requirements, look for senior and junior job posting you want to hold in the future and
read the requirements, the skills listed are your targets for development.

## Find Unique Projects

The last thing you should do is pickup boilerplate projects or follow generic tutorials, the only thing you will learn this way is how to relay on other people
to show you what and how to do things and since everybody can do that your projects wont stand out.

You should instead pick out-of-the box ideas that interest you and work with the mindset that you will realize this project
no matter what it takes. Find the right tools to use, learn a new programming language, a new framework or libraries along the way.

## Balance theory with practice

- Learn theory as you need it, don't try to learn everything at once, you will forget most of it. 
- Give alot of importance to the basics its the foundational knowledge that you will build everything on.

## Showcase showcase showcase


- github : use special repos, write a good readmes for your projects.
- personal site : write blog posts, make demo videos.
- social : use social media to show your progress on your projects, share original ideas and experiences.Your posts should not be for barging but actually a medium where you share what you learned with others, so keep it short, informative, and write it yourself !

## Learn the good practices

- Stop using jupyter notebooks for everything, really ! [learn from the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U)
- Start writing modular code.
- Learn how to make your programming environment reproducible (docker, pyenv, virtualenv).
- Document your code (docstrings, comments, readme).
- Learn programming conventions and best practices.
- Learn to lint, type and test your code.
- [here](https://goodresearch.dev/) thank me later !
- Learn how to use git for version controling and collaboration.

## Contribute to open-source/communities

Alone we go fast, together we go turbo. 
One of the biggest favors you can do to yourself is to contribute to open-source.
Help build the tools you use, learn from the best, and get your name out there.

## Learn how to write professional emails

This one may sound basic, but believe me when I say, most of the emails I get from junior students are *terrible*.

A good written email makes all the difference.
